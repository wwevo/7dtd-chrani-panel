Interactive online-map for the game [Seven Days to Die](http://7daystodie.com).
Based on the mapdata [Allocs-Mod](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?12837-Improvements-for-the-dedicated-server) creates on the server- The mod is neccessary for this to run.
Inspired by Allocs Webserver+map (stole a few lines as well ^^)

Data from the Botman-Bot can be easily integrated if you happen to run it yourself.
This is a project in active development+planning+experimenting. Let's call it Early Access ^^

Don't ask me how to set this up, I'm happy it's running at all :)
